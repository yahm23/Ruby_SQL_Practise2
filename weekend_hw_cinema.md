## CodeClan Cinema (CCC (again))

:star: This is a PDA Homework :star:

Create a system that handles bookings for our newly built cinema!
It's enough if you can call your methods in pry, don't worry about an interface.

### Your app should have:
  - Customers
    - name
    - funds

  - Films
    - title
    - price

  - Tickets
    - customer_id
    - film_id

### Your app should be able to:
  - Create customers, films and tickets
  - CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete) customers, films and tickets.
  - Show which films a customer has booked to see, and see which customers are coming to see one film.

### Basic extensions:
  - Buying tickets should decrease the funds of the customer by the price
  - Check how many tickets were bought by a customer
  - Check how many customers are going to watch a certain film

### Advanced extensions:
  - Create a screenings table that lets us know what time films are showing
  
  - Write a method that finds out what is the most popular time (most tickets sold) for a given film

  film method: film1.most_popular_showing will output the time of most pop ie most tix sold
 that means change the ticket class to

  - Limit the available tickets for screenings.
  - Add any other extensions you think would be great to have at a cinema!
